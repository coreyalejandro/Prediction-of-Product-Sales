# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the BigMart sales data. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet. The data scientists at BigMart will use this model to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

The scatterplot of 'Item_Outlet_Sales' by 'Item_MRP' shows a clear positive relationship between the maximum retail price (MRP) of an item and its sales. Items with a higher MRP tend to have higher sales.

# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the BigMart sales data. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet. The data scientists at BigMart will use this model to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

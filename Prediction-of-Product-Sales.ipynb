        "The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.\n",

        "Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.\n",
        "The data scientists at BigMart also left us with this short, but important message:\n",
        ">Please note that the data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly."

        "Based on our understanding of the problem and the domain, as well as our personal experiences and perspectives, we have generated the following hypotheses about the factors that might influence product sales at BigMart:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Product-Related Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quality**: Products with superior quality, as indicated by user ratings, are likely to have higher sales.\n",
        "- **Price**: The relationship between price and sales is likely to be complex. Extremely high prices might deter some customers, while very low prices might raise questions about the product's quality. There might be an optimal price range that maximizes sales.\n",
        "- **Packaging**: The packaging of a product, including its visual appeal and the information it provides, might influence sales. Products with more attractive or informative packaging might have higher sales.\n",
        "- **Brand**: Products from well-known or highly regarded brands are likely to have higher sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Store-Related Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Location**: Stores located in more populated or affluent areas, or in areas with fewer competing stores, are likely to have higher overall sales.\n",
        "- **Size and Layout**: Larger stores, or stores with more effective layouts, are likely to have higher overall sales.\n",
        "- **Staff**: Stores with more knowledgeable and helpful staff are likely to have higher overall sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Sales and Marketing Strategy Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Product Bundling**: Bundling related products together, or placing them near each other in the store, might increase sales of those products.\n",
        "- **Sales**: Products that are on sale are likely to have higher sales. However, if a product is always on sale, customers might start to perceive the sale price as the regular price.\n",
        "- **One-Stop Shopping**: Grouping all the products needed for a particular event or occasion together might increase sales of those products.\n",
        "- **In-Store Advertising**: Advertising a product in different parts of the store, not just near where it's usually located, might increase sales of that product.\n",
        "\n",
        "These hypotheses will guide our exploratory data analysis. We will explore the data with these hypotheses in mind, looking for patterns and relationships that might support or contradict them."
